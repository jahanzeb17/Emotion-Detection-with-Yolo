# Real-Time Emotion Detection using YOLOv8 and Supervision

This project demonstrates real-time **emotion detection** from video input using a **YOLOv8** model fine-tuned on a custom emotion detection dataset. It uses the **Supervision** library for drawing bounding boxes and class labels.

## 📂 Project Overview

Using a fine-tuned YOLOv8 model, this system detects and classifies human emotions in video frames. The model identifies eight emotional states and annotates them on the video output.

## 🔍 Detected Emotions

The model detects the following 8 emotion classes:

| ID | Emotion   |
|----|-----------|
| 0  | Anger     |
| 1  | Content   |
| 2  | Disgust   |
| 3  | Fear      |
| 4  | Happy     |
| 5  | Neutral   |
| 6  | Sad       |
| 7  | Surprise  |
